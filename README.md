# 🌍 BGP Data Analysis Through Big Data Analytics

## 📌 Overview
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the backbone of the internet, responsible for determining how data moves between networks (Autonomous Systems, or AS). This project explores the full lifecycle of BGP data analysis using Big Data techniques—covering ingestion, processing, storage, analysis, and visualization. The goal is to uncover global internet routing patterns, detect anomalies, and optimize traffic routing.

## 🏆 Project Objectives
- Understand BGP and its significance in network routing.
- Collect real-time and historical BGP data from trusted sources.
- Process, clean, and store BGP data efficiently.
- Perform data analytics to identify trends and anomalies.
- Visualize key insights using various tools.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Understanding BGP & Big Data Analytics
**Why BGP Matters in Big Data Analytics?**
- 📈 **Anomaly Detection**: Identify routing issues like hijacks and outages.
- 🚦 **Traffic Optimization**: Analyze global internet traffic patterns.
- 🔮 **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast network disruptions and performance issues.

🔍 **Task:** Read an article on BGP basics and summarize how BGP data can be analyzed using Big Data techniques.

---

### 2️⃣ Data Ingestion (BGP Data Collection)
**Sources for BGP Data:**
- **RIPE NCC (Routing Information Service - RIS)** → Real-time & historical data.
- **RouteViews** → MRT format files for historical analysis.
- **CAIDA** → Anomaly detection & AS relationships.

🔍 **Task:**
- Download a dataset from RIPE NCC or RouteViews.
- Use `pybgpstream` to extract:
  - Top 5 prefixes with the most changes.
  - Frequently withdrawn prefixes.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Processing (Preparing BGP Data)
- Install necessary tools (`pybgpstream`, `BGPDump` for MRT files).
- Extract relevant fields:
  - **Prefixes** (IP ranges announced by networks)
  - **AS-PATH** (Sequence of ASes a route passes through)
  - **Announcements/Withdrawals** (Routes added/removed)
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.

🔍 **Task:** Identify:
- Top 5 prefixes with the most changes.
- Frequently withdrawn prefixes.

---

### 4️⃣ Data Storage (Big Data Storage)
💾 **Storage Options:**
- **SQLite/MySQL** (For small datasets)
- **MongoDB/HBase** (For large datasets)

📂 **Schema Design:**
- **Fields:** Prefixes, AS-PATH, timestamps, announcements/withdrawals.

🔍 **Task:**
- Store processed BGP data in SQLite or MongoDB.
- Write a query to find the **top 5 AS paths** used for a specific prefix.

---

### 5️⃣ Data Analytics (Analyzing BGP Data)
🔍 **Insights to Extract:**
- Routing trends (frequency of route changes, longest AS paths).
- Patterns in withdrawn prefixes.
- Anomaly detection (sudden spikes in withdrawn prefixes, unusually long AS paths).

🔍 **Task:**
- Identify prefixes with the highest updates.
- Detect unusually long AS paths.

---

### 6️⃣ Data Visualization
📊 **Metrics to Visualize:**
- Number of route changes over time.
- Geographic distribution of AS data.
- Frequency of withdrawals.

🛠 **Tools:** `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `Tableau`

🔍 **Task:** Create at least two visualizations:
1. **Line Graph** for route changes.
2. **Bar Chart** for top prefixes with the most updates.

---

### 7️⃣ Summary Report
📃 **Key Sections:**
- Overview of findings.
- Trends and anomalies detected.
- Visual representations and their significance.

🔍 **Task:** Compile your analysis and insights into a structured report.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** `pybgpstream`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`
- **Big Data Tools:** MongoDB, SQLite, Hadoop (optional)
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib, Plotly

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
✅ Gain hands-on experience with real-world **Big Data** processing.
✅ Understand **internet routing** and **BGP anomalies**.
✅ Improve skills in **data collection, processing, storage, and visualization**.
✅ Be able to detect potential **cybersecurity threats and routing inefficiencies**.
